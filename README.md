# ArtGalleryProb
Attempting the Art Gallery Program in Python.

The art gallery problem is about finding the minimum number of guards that can observe a whole gallery in the shape of a polygon.

Takes an input array of polygon vertices in the form of cartesian coordinates, triangulates the polygon, finds a valid tricoloring, and outputs an upper-bound on the minimum number of guards necessary. Uses Fisk's short proof of the problem.

Sample vertex inputs are stored as variables for testing/debugging but are otherwise unecessary.
